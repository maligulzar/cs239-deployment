{"id":"1069","title":"Heap corruption under Win32; how to locate?","body":"<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>\n\n<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>\n\n<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>\n\n<p>Now here's the rub:<br>\nWhen it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>\n<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>\n\n<p>A colleague just walked past and asked \"Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?\"</p>\n\n<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.

{"id":"1535","title":"Reducing duplicate error handling code in C#?","body":"<p>I've never been completely happy with the way exception handling works, there's a lot exceptions and try/catch brings to the table (stack unwinding, etc.), but it seems to break a lot of the OO model in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));\nbool success = false;\nwhile (!success)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail\n        success = true;\n    }\n    catch (IOException e)\n    {\n        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)\n        {\n            throw e;\n        }\n        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()\n    {\n        // some code block\n    } );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired.

Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts or experience on whether multiple DataContexts (corresponding to DB namespaces) are appropriate in place of (or in addition to) one very large DataContext class (corresponding to the whole DB)?</p>","accepted_answer_id":"5310","answer_count":"5","comment_count":"0","community_owned_date":null,"creation_date":"1217915674.697","favorite_count":"2","last_activity_date":"1403038774.913","last_edit_date":"1332374487.907","last_editor_display_name":"Yaakov","last_editor_user_id":"3","owner_display_name":"","owner_user_id":"51","post_type_id":"1","score":"23","tags":"asp.net|.net|linq-to-sql|datacontext","view_count":"4596"}

{"id":"2328","title":"Tracking state using ASP.NET AJAX / ICallbackEventHandler","body":"<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>\n\n<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>\n\n<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (\"OnColumnMoved\" or \"OnRowMoved\").</p>\n\n<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>\n\n<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>\n\n<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>\n\n<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>\n\n<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>","accepted_answer_id":"4910","answer_count":"5","comment_count":"0","community_owned_date":null,"creation_date":"1217944332.72","favorite_count":null,"last_activity_date":"1221863905.603","last_edit_date":"1221863905.603","last_editor_display_name":"Shog9","last_editor_user_id":"811","owner_display_name":"","owner_user_id":"67","post_type_id":"1","score":"6","tags":"asp.net|ajax|asp.net-ajax|viewstate","view_count":"2406"}

The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be.</p>\n\n<p>What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVRJB.png\" alt=\"form design\"></p>\n\n<p>Basically I have to work with this huge form, with container controls all over the place, and then do a bunch of run-time reformatting to make it all work.

I understand that this is not a good solution since it gives SharePoint timer service more rights then it is supposed to have. But it at least allows my SharePoint timer job to run <code>stsadm</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem with running the timer service under local administrator is that this user won't necessarily have <code>SHAREPOINT\\System</code> SharePoint privileges which I also need for this SharePoint job. It turns out that <code>SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> won't work in this case. Reflector shows that <code>RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> checks if the current process is <code>owstimer</code> (the service process which runs SharePoint jobs) and performs no elevation this is the case (the rational here, I guess, is that the timer service is supposed to run under <code>NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService</code> windows account which which has <code>SHAREPOINT\\System</code> SharePoint privileges, and thus there's no need to elevate privileges for a timer job).</p>\n\n<p>The only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual NetworkService windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to System.Diagnostics.Process.Run() trough the StarInfo's Username, domain and password.</p>\n\n<p>It seems everything should work now, but here is another problem I'm stuck with at the moment.

As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the AppSettings. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the AppSettings constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the AppSettings constantly.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using AppSettings is supposed to be \"the right way\" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>\n\n<p>According to the MSDN documention, the ConfigurationManager is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because Properties does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>\n\n<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties.

{"id":"5831","title":"Binary patch-generation in C#","body":"<p>Does anyone have, or know of, a binary patch generation algorithm implementation in C#?</p>\n\n<p>Basically, compare two files (designated <em>old</em> and <em>new</em>), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the <em>old</em> file to have the same contents as the <em>new</em> file.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>\n\n<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>\n\n<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>\n\n<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>\n<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>\n<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>\n<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>\n<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>\n<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>\n<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>\n\n<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>\n\n<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/lvknet/source/browse/trunk/LVK/IO/Patching/Binary/BinaryPatch.cs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source code to the above algorithm</a></p>\n\n<p>You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems.

Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also \"leaks\" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information.

The current code can be found <a href=\"http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What is the \"best\" way to abstract this data within the <code>Tvdb()</code> class?</p>\n\n<p>I originally used a extended <code>Dict()</code> that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = \"something\"</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>\n\n<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = \"something\"</code></p>\n\n<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if <code>x[3][24]</code> was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception).</p>\n\n<p>Currently it's using four classes: <code>ShowContainer</code>, <code>Show</code>, <code>Season</code> and <code>Episode</code>. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the <code>search()</code> function on <code>Show()</code> for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's <code>self.data</code> dict, if not, <code>raise season_not_found</code>. I can also check in <code>Season()</code> if it has that episode and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code> functions, it's easy to accidentally recursively call <code>__getitem__</code> (so I'm not sure if extending the <code>Dict</code> class will cause problems).</p>\n\n<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old <code>Dict</code> method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See <code>_setItem</code> and <code>_setData</code>. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly... Elegant.</p>\n\n<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the <code>ShowContainer</code>/etc classes with <code>Dict</code> cause problems?</p>","accepted_answer_id":"10778","answer_count":"5","comment_count":"0","community_owned_date":null,"creation_date":"1218204345.29","favorite_count":null,"last_activity_date":"1490820342.267","last_edit_date":"1490820342.267","last_editor_display_name":"Chris Fournier","last_editor_user_id":"604687","owner_display_name":"dbr","owner_user_id":"745","post_type_id":"1","score":"12","tags":"python|data-structures","view_count":"706"}

Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>\n\n<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>\n\n<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs \"release candidates.\" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>\n\n<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>\n\n<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is \"base\" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>\n\n<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thanks for the reference to Tarantino.

If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file.

A click or move on the screen is still considered a \"Mouse\" event.  It was done this way so that code could port over from full Windows easily.  And this is not a Windows Mobile specific issue.  The TextBox control on Windows does not have native mouse events either.  I just happened to be using Windows Mobile in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  And on a side note...as Windows Mobile is built of the WindowsCE core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and Slim Terminal Services clients or \"WinTerms\" it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time.  Most devices just don't have the ports to plug one in.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to the .Net Framework, the\n  MouseDown Event Handler on a TextBox\n  is supported.

It is however, overridden (and changed to private I believe) in the TextBox class.  So it will not show up in IntelliSense in Visual Studio.</p>\n\n<p>However, you actually can write the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>textBox1.MouseDown += new System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventHandler(this.textBox1_MouseDown);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it will compile and run just fine, the only problem is that textBox1_MouseDown() will not be fired when you tap the TextBox control.  I assume this is because of the Event being overridden internally.  I don't even want to change what's happening on the event internally, I just want to add my own event handler to that event so I can fire some custom code as you could with any other event.</p>","accepted_answer_id":"7840","answer_count":"5","comment_count":"1","community_owned_date":null,"creation_date":"1218458180.35","favorite_count":null,"last_activity_date":"1324397902.943","last_edit_date":"1324397902.943","last_editor_display_name":"","last_editor_user_id":"396458","owner_display_name":"","owner_user_id":"194","post_type_id":"1","score":"1","tags":"c#|.net|events|windows-mobile","view_count":"10344"}

This is achieved by placing an invisible <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and styling it with:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>#MyDiv iframe\n{\n    position: absolute;\n    z-index: -1;\n    filter: mask();\n    border: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 9999px;\n    height: 9999px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an even better solution than this one?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: The purpose of this question is as much informative as it is a real question.

Could this be done in .NET 3.x using extension methods? Create an interface, and implement the interface in the extension methods (which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch).

Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.</p>\n\n<p>This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the <code>SuperException</code> - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, <code>SuperAssembly.DLL</code>, which I referenced.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all <code>SuperExceptions</code> with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here's the thing:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>All uses of <code>SuperException</code> have been eliminated from the project's code.</li>\n<li>Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, I only reference one more assembly - and <code>that</code> references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself.

{"id":"9191","title":"How to obtain good concurrent read performance from disk","body":"<p>I'd like to ask a question then follow it up with my own answer, but also see what answers other people have.</p>\n\n<p>We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.</p>\n\n<p>Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.</p>\n\n<p>If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?</strong>  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Some details:</p>\n\n<p>The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.</p>\n\n<p>The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.</p>","accepted_answer_id":"9826","answer_count":"6","comment_count":"0","community_owned_date":null,"creation_date":"1218570613.44","favorite_count":"9","last_activity_date":"1429518361.877","last_edit_date":"1223636779.557","last_editor_display_name":"\u03a4\u0396\u03a9\u03a4\u0396\u0399\u039f\u03a5","last_editor_user_id":"6899","owner_display_name":"pauldoo","owner_user_id":"755","post_type_id":"1","score":"23","tags":"windows|multithreading|file-io","view_count":"6122"}

CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any tips on how to reproduce a problem like this in a non-production environment?

{"id":"9615","title":"Displaying vector graphics in a browser","body":"<p>I need to display some interactive (attaching with DOM listeners etc. and event handling) vector graphics in web site I am working on. There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - <a href=\"http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"excanvas\">excanvas</a>, <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-programmatic-dijit-and-dojo/drawing-gfx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GFX of Dojo Toolkit</a> and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.</p>\n\n<p>So the question actually consists of several parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?</li>\n<li>If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc.</li>\n<li>The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities.</li>\n<li>Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7.</li>\n<li>Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes.</li>\n<li>I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library <a href=\"http://www.degrafa.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Degrafa</a>. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[<strong>EDIT 2</strong>] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by \"Windows lock-in\" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one <em>is able to</em> launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user.</p>\n\n<p>@Akira: Have you had any problems with those \"SVG renderers\" on IE7?

This is entirely unsatisfactory. I considered two possibilities to solve this problem:</p>\n\n<p>The first is to lock the document when it is opened by someone the first time, and unlock it when it is closed. But if the network connection to the server is suddenly interrupted, the document would stay in a forever-locked state. The obvious solution is to send regular pings to the server. If the server doesn't receive K pings in a row (K > 1) from a particular client, documents locked by this client are unlocked. If that client re-appears, documents are locked again, if someone hadn't already locked them. This could also help if the client application (running in web browser) is terminated unexpectedly, making it impossible to send a 'quitting, unlock my documents' signal to the server.</p>\n\n<p>The second is to store multiple versions of the same document saved by different users. If changes to the document are made in rapid succession, the system would offer either to merge versions or to select a preferred version. To optimize storage space, only document diffs should be kept (just like source control software).</p>\n\n<p>What method should I choose, taking into consideration that the connection to the server might <em>sometimes</em> be slow and unresponsive?

I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.
